Sudoku 'light' in Angular

Builds easy 3x3 Sudoku board. Players can change values of board cells by clicking into a cell and are then
asked to chose a number between 1-3 to add to the board. 

Automated checks trigger display of msg and highlight conflicting cells to reflect that entered value was not valid 
(validation based on uniqueness of row and column values).

Angular, ui-router, node.js/ express.js static file server
